## Introduction
Lingo.dev CLI is a free, open-source CLI for translating apps and content with AI. It’s designed to replace traditional translation management software while integrating with existing pipelines.
To get up and running, read the [Quickstart](https://lingo.dev/en/cli/quick-start) guide.

## Why Lingo.dev CLI?
- Supports all major LLM providers, such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

## How it works
At a high-level, Lingo.dev CLI:
1. Extracts translatable content from a variety of file formats.
2. Sends the extracted content to an LLM provider for translation.
3. Writes the changes back to the file system.
4. Keeps track of what's been translated to prevent unnecessary retranslation.
For a deeper dive into each of these steps, see [How it works](https://lingo.dev/en/cli/how-it-works).
